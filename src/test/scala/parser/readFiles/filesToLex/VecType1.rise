f::4xF32 --4xF32 for vec(4,f32)
f=(vectorFromScalar 4) [F32]  --F32 is lexed as an TypeIdentifier, but it is an Type and if I put Brackets '[' around everything then I have an endless loop. Only solution seems to be only around Types an '[' but then it thinks it is from '4' dependend, so we need an ( ) around the expression 'vectorFromScalar 4'
